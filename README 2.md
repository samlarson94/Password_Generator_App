# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## The Project
- Added variable and query selector for button
- Created variables to store user input, as well as sources for future arrays to pull from
- Created prompts and confirms to gather user input
- Created checks to make sure user input was correct, messages to correct the user if they entered something wrong
- Created if statements check boolean values of selected inputs and concat into a random array
- Took random array and scrambled it to create a new array of random values
- Created a for loop to select a number of random characters based off of the user's input passwordLength. Stored characters into randomCharacter variable.
- Pushed randomCharacters into a final passwordArray.  Used .join to remove spaces and create string. 
- Added the newly created string to a writePassword function, which replaces the text value for HTML id "#password" with the newly created, randomized string.
- Added some styling to practice Js DOM.
